# WebDevAssignment2

This assignment wants us to recreate methods using JavaScript functions. The methods we are recreating are:

forEach()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.forEach” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myEach” that will take in an array of elements and execute any callback function on each of those elements.

map()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.map” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myMap” that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements.

filter()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.filter” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myFilter” that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements.

some() 

Without using the native “Array.prototype.some” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “mySome” that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements.

every()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.every” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myEvery” that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements.

reduce()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.reduce” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myReduce” that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements.

includes()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.includes” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myIncludes” that will take in an array of elements and indicate whether or not a target element is contained within the input array. This returns a boolean.

indexOf()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.indexOf” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myIndexOf” that will take in an array of elements and returns the index of the first encounter of a target element (if it is found) or -1 if that element does not exist within the input array.

push()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.push” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myPush” that will take in an array of elements as well as an elementToAdd and append that element to the end of the array.

lastIndexOf()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.lastIndexOf” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myLastIndexOf” that will take in an array of elements and returns the index of the last encounter of a target element (if it is found) or -1 if that element does not exist within the input array.

Object.keys()

Without using the native “Object.keys()” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “grabKeys” that will take in an object and return all of the keys of the key:value pairs of that object.

Object.values()

Without using the native “Object.values()” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “grabValues” that will take in an object and return all of the values of the key:value pairs of that object.
